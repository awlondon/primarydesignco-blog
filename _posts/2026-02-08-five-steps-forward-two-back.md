  AI dramatically compresses the distance between intention and executable code.
  What it does not compress is the distance between system behavior and human
  understanding. This essay uses a three-day sprint building the Maya Dev Interface
  to examine why regression, frustration, and cognitive overload remain structural
  features of development—even in the age of large language models.

## Opening: A sprint that worked—and didn’t

Introduce the paradox: a functioning SaaS built in ~30 hours, an interactive artifact
successfully shipped, and yet a persistent subjective sense of regression, circularity,
and friction. Establish credibility without resolving the tension.

## Compression of execution, not comprehension

Develop the central distinction between faster code generation and unchanged (or
worsened) system interpretability. Show how feature velocity outpaces human mental
models, producing the illusion that progress should be linear.

## Why regression feels new—but isn’t

Reframe regression as a structural consequence of changing invariants rather than
tool failure. Situate the experience historically within software development, while
showing how AI accelerates its visibility and frequency.

## Prompt convergence vs. system-state divergence

Explain how repeated prompts can converge linguistically while the underlying system
diverges behaviorally. Connect this directly to the experience of issuing many prompts
with diminishing perceived returns.

(Insert diagram or SVG illustrating divergence.)

## Feature velocity as cognitive debt

Argue that AI enables solo builders to exceed their own working-memory limits.
Introduce “mental model debt” as distinct from technical debt, and show how it
amplifies debugging difficulty under acceleration.

## The human-in-the-loop concentrates, not disappears

Reframe the human role as interpreter, arbiter of intent, debugger of assumptions,
and regulator of emotional state. Treat emotional volatility as an engineering
variable rather than a personal failing.

## LLMs as stabilizers, not saviors

Use Ankaa as a concrete example of how LLMs support continuity under cognitive
overload. Be precise: not understanding, not autonomy, but persistence, reframing,
and option generation.

## Conclusion: Prompt-to-system stewardship

Reset expectations for AI-assisted development. Argue that the future is not
prompt-to-product, but prompt-to-system stewardship—where interpretability,
documentation, and judgment remain central.

## Contextual recommendation

Frame the Maya Dev Interface as documentation-as-execution: an attempt to make
system state, intent, and iteration legible rather than magical.
