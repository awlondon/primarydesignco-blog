  Large language models do not originate ideas; they contextualize human input.
  This essay argues that the economic role of humans in an AGI economy is not
  output production but originality generation—and that anomaly detection is
  the missing interface.

Anomaly Detection Engine (ADE)
Type your hypothesis or idea.

This interface evaluates predictability, not truth. It decomposes your input, positions each component against existing knowledge, and estimates where—if anywhere—your thinking departs meaningfully from prior art. Outputs include an originality score, partial originality flags, and cited lineages for derivative components.

## Thirty Minutes of Thinking as Signal

This essay was produced from roughly thirty minutes of concentrated, uninterrupted thought. That fact matters more than the word count that follows.

In an AGI-saturated environment, outputs are no longer scarce. Summaries, explanations, and derivative prose can be generated on demand at near-zero marginal cost. What remains scarce is non-derivative cognition: the act of forming a hypothesis that meaningfully departs from prior formulations while remaining coherent enough to test, extend, or falsify.

From an economic perspective, those thirty minutes are not valued by time, but by leverage.

If a single concentrated thinking session produces:

- a defensible conceptual distinction (originality vs. derivation),

- a reframing of human–AGI roles,

- and a designable interface concept (the ADE),

then its value is not comparable to wage labor or content production. It is comparable to early-stage research, product definition, or hypothesis generation—activities whose downstream value routinely compounds by orders of magnitude.

A conservative way to price this:

Comparable human labor: senior research, strategy, or product-definition work often clears $150–$300/hour.

Thirty minutes, at that rate, is $75–$150 if the output is consumed once.

But this output is not consumed once. It is:

- reusable,

- refinable,

- and amplifiable by AGI across audiences and contexts.

When an idea becomes a template for further reasoning, its expected value shifts from hourly compensation to option value. Even if only a small fraction of such ideas mature into tools, products, or research directions, the expected value of the originating cognitive act can plausibly reach thousands to tens of thousands of dollars over time.

The critical point is not the exact number. It is this:
in an AGI economy, the unit of value is not output, but original signal. Thirty minutes of genuine thinking can dominate weeks of derivative production.

## What LLMs Actually Do (and Don’t)

Large language models do not discover new knowledge. They do not form hypotheses in the scientific or philosophical sense, and they do not generate originality ex nihilo.

What they do—exceptionally well—is position user input against a vast, compressed representation of prior human knowledge. When a person provides an idea, the model:

- decomposes it into latent components,

- maps those components onto existing patterns,

- and estimates their likelihood, coherence, and adjacency.

This is why LLMs feel “creative” while remaining fundamentally derivative. They are mirrors with context: they reflect your input, but surrounded by everything that has been said before.

Crucially, this also means LLMs are excellent detectors of non-originality. They can identify when an idea closely tracks established formulations, when it recombines familiar components, and when it departs from known trajectories in ways that are statistically or conceptually unusual.

That capability is often misinterpreted. The model is not having the original thought. It is recognizing that the human has produced something anomalous relative to the corpus.

This distinction matters because it defines the correct division of labor in an AGI economy:

- Humans supply anomaly, intuition, value judgments, and conceptual risk.

- AGI supplies context, compression, verification scaffolding, and amplification.

When AGI is treated as a replacement for human thinking, it collapses into derivative output engines. When it is treated as an evaluator and amplifier of human originality, it becomes a force multiplier for cognition.

The Anomaly Detection Engine proposed in this essay formalizes that relationship. It does not ask AGI to be creative. It asks AGI to recognize when a human is being creative, and to explain why.

## Anomaly, Novelty, and Truth (A Necessary Distinction)
Before describing the Anomaly Detection Engine, three terms must be separated. Much of the confusion around “AI creativity” comes from collapsing them.

Truth concerns correspondence with reality. An idea can be true or false regardless of whether it is original. Most truths are rediscoveries.

Novelty concerns surface-level difference. A recombination of familiar ideas phrased differently may feel new while remaining fully derivative.

Anomaly concerns statistical and conceptual deviation within a structured space of prior knowledge. An anomalous idea is one that:

- does not closely match known formulations,

- is not easily predicted from adjacent concepts,

- yet remains internally coherent.

Anomaly is the scarce signal AGI can detect but not generate. It is also the signal most correlated with downstream discovery, innovation, and creative value.

The ADE is designed to operate strictly at this level. It does not assess truth. It does not reward novelty for its own sake. It identifies where human thought departs meaningfully from precedent.

## The Anomaly Detection Engine (ADE)

The ADE is not a creativity engine. It is an epistemic instrument.

Its purpose is to answer one question:
To what extent does this human input meaningfully deviate from what is already known?

#### Inputs

- A free-form prompt: “Type your hypothesis or idea.”

- Optional context tags (domain, intent, constraints).

### Core process

#### Semantic decomposition
The input is parsed into discrete claims, assumptions, and relational structures. Complex ideas are split so that partial originality can be detected.

#### Manifold positioning
Each component is embedded against a large, multimodal knowledge representation: academic literature, technical patterns, historical arguments, and common heuristics.

#### Predictability estimation
The system estimates how likely each component would be generated given existing distributions. High-likelihood components are flagged as derivative; low-likelihood but coherent components are flagged as anomalous.

#### Lineage tracing
For derivative components, the system surfaces proximate sources: established theories, prior art, or canonical framings. These are not accusations; they are context.

#### Aggregation and explanation
The ADE outputs:

an overall anomaly score (with uncertainty),

a breakdown by sub-idea,

a short explanation of why certain parts are considered original or derivative,

citations for detected lineages.

The result is not judgment, but orientation. The user can see where their thinking is doing real work.

#### Diagram 1: Human Thought in a Knowledge Manifold

This diagram represents the core intuition behind the ADE.

Description (to accompany SVG):
A dense manifold represents accumulated human knowledge. Most ideas fall along well-traveled gradients. Anomalous ideas appear as vectors that depart from these gradients while remaining structurally coherent. The ADE measures distance and direction—not correctness.

This diagram visually reinforces a key claim: originality is geometric, not mystical.

#### Diagram 2: The Creative Cognition Economy Loop

Description:
Humans generate hypotheses → AGI evaluates anomaly → anomalous inputs are amplified, refined, and tested → value accrues downstream → humans are compensated for original signal, not output volume.

This loop reframes AGI from replacement technology to cognitive market maker.

## Why This Interface Matters

Without an ADE-like interface, AGI systems default to rewarding:

- verbosity,

- stylistic polish,

- confidence signaling.

Those are cheap to fake and easy to automate.

With an ADE, incentives shift toward:

- clarity of thought,

- conceptual risk,

- and genuine deviation from precedent.

This is how AGI becomes compatible with a human creative economy rather than hostile to it.
