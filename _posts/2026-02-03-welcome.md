This is the first post on our new blog. It sets the stage for a daily series of long-form essays that explore design, systems thinking and creative practice.

## The Purpose of this Blog

At Primary Design Co, we believe in documenting our thoughts and work transparently. This blog serves as a daily catalog of insights drawn from practice, research, and reflection.

## A Structured Reading Experience

Each post is designed to be read in about twenty minutes. We break the narrative into clear sections and pause 4–5 times using lightly separated ad inserts. This provides a rhythm for longer reading sessions without diminishing the integrity of the content.

## Citations and References

We will provide well-sourced citations throughout our posts, drawing from academic literature, industry whitepapers and primary data. References will be collected at the end of each article.
