  This essay argues that recursive geometric systems are not visualizations
  but cognitive instruments. Using HLSF Show v11 as a case study, it examines
  hierarchy, scaling limits, perceptual constraint, and the design implications
  for an AGI economy.

Most generative geometry is presented as spectacle. It dazzles, but it does not teach. What you are seeing above is not intended as ornament. It is a recursive instrument.
